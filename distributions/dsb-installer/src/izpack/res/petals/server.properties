# PEtALS properties
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#This property specifies the name of the container. In distributed mode, this property is mandatory
# and must match a container name in the topology.xml file
petals.container.name=$installer.server.name

#This property set the maximum duration of the processing of a life-cycle operation on a JBI
# components and SAs (start, stop, ...). It prevents from hanging threads. 
petals.task.timeout=120000

#This property specifies the URL path to the PEtALS repository. PEtALS holds its JBI configuration 
# in this repository and can recover this configuration from it.
#If not specified, the default repository is in $PETALS_HOME/repository.
#petals.repository.path=file:///home/test/repository

#This property is used to activate the control of exchange acceptance by target component when
# the NMR routes messages (see isExchangeWithConsumerOkay and isExchangeWithProviderOkay methods
# in JBI Component interface)
# If not specified, the false value is selected by default.
#petals.exchange.validation=true

# This property is used to isolate the ClassLoaders created for Shared Libraries and Components 
# from the PEtALS container one.
# It can be useful to avoid concurrent libraries loading issues.
# If not specified, the false value is selected by default
petals.classloaders.isolated=true

# This property is used to unactivate the autoloader service.
#It can be useful in production environment to unactivate this service.
petals.autoloader=true

# This property set up the policy of the Quality of Service supported by Petals Transporter.
# Possible values are : reliable, secure, fast.
# If not specified, the reliable policy is selected by default
petals.transport.qos=fast

# Alternate topology configuration file URL. This value must be a valid URL like :
#  - http://localhost:8080/petals/topology.xml
#  - file:///home/petals/config/topology.xml
#  - or any valid URL (java.net.URL validation)
# If not specified, the local topology.xml file is used
#petals.topology.url=


# This property defines the routing strategy
# Two kind of strategy can be defines: 'highest' or 'random'.
# The following parameters, separated by commas, represent respectively the weighting for a local
# endpoint, the weighting for a remote active endpoint and the weighting for a remote inactive endpoint.
# The 'random' strategy chooses an endpoint randomly in function of the defined weightings.
# Every endpoint has a chance to be elected, but the more the weight is strong, the more the endpoint
# can be elected.
# The 'highest' strategy chooses an endpoint amongst the endpoints with the strongest weight.
# If not specified, the strategy 'random,1,1,1' is selected by default
#petals.routing.strategy=random,1,1,1

#Set the following properties in order to establish SSL connections.

# This property defines the key password to retrieve the private key.
#petals.ssl.key.password=yourKeyPassword

# This property defines the keystore file where the keys are stored.
#petals.ssl.keystore.file=/yourPath/yourKeystoreFile

# This property defines the keystore password.
#petals.ssl.keystore.password=yourKeystorePassword

# This property defines the truststore file where the signatures are verified.
#petals.ssl.truststore.file=/yourPath/yourTruststoreFile

# This property defines the truststore password.
#petals.ssl.truststore.password=yourTruststorePassword
